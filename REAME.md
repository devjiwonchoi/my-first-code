# My First Code

> Ah, the good old days. :cowboy_hat_face:

## Background

I found this [`Ang.bat`](./Ang.bat) in my sent emails, which contains the first code I've ever written throughout my entire career.

Back in those days, my friend and I did a prank on each other by `"hacking"`, and it started with sending an email of interesting content like meme photos and this `.bat` file with a single line of code:

```bat
shutdown -s -t 30
```

It initiates a forced shutdown of a Windows machine after 30 seconds.

> :bulb: To `deactivate` this `virus` (as we called it), you can simply open the Command Prompt and type `shutdown -a` to abort the shutdown process.

## How did I time travel this commit to 2012?
